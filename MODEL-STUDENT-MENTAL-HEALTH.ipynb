    "Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, a Random Forest Classifier was used to predict the likelihood of students experiencing depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve accuracy and control overfitting. It works well with mixed data types (categorical and numerical) and captures nonlinear relationships—which are common in psychological and behavioral datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning:\n",
    "Student mental health data often involves complex, nonlinear factors (academic pressure, sleep, financial stress, etc.).\n",
    "Random Forest captures these multidimensional patterns better than Logistic Regression, which is more linear and sensitive to noise.\n",
    "As seen in the results, Random Forest achieved:\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher accuracy across all three mental health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better F1-scores (balance between precision and recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "More stable predictions even with a small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Classifier proved to be more effective for this analysis because:\n",
    "\n",
    "It adapts well to real-world behavioral data, which rarely follows strict linear patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "It maintained consistent performance across multiple targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It offered better interpretability for non-technical audiences through feature importance (if analyzed further).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Random Forest was chosen over Logistic Regression due to its superior predictive power, flexibility, and robustness in modeling student mental health outcomes."
